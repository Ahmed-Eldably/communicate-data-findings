# communicate-data-findings

I chose Ford GoBike System Dataset betwee January 2019 and December 2019 for my Anaylsis.

There are two datsets in the branch:

fordgo_bike_master.csv: The original dataset from mergin every month of 2019 datsets.
bikes_master_ordered.csv: The cleaned dataset from the original one.


# Exploratory data analysis findings

1. The most usage of bikes were in thee morning between 7 - 9 AM in the morning and 16 - 19 which is a tpyical workingday
2. Thursdays and Tuesdays are the most popular days for using bikes, however Wednesday, Mondays and Fridays are very close to Tues & Weds numbers. All of that suggests that Bike usage are more usable on the workdays than weekends.

# Explanatory data analysis findings

The Multivariate Exploration strengthened most of the patterns from my previous findings. The short period of bike usage are for subscribers that use it for a very short duration between Monday and Friday, which indicates to that bikes are used for work/study commute. On the other hand, plots are showing that customers have a very flexiable duration and also they use bikes more often on weekends, which suggests that they use for tours or lesisure.
